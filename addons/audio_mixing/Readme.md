# Audio Mixing
Audio Busses should be used to enable seperate volume settings for music, voice and effects.

- [Audio Buss Tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.html)
- [Audio Stream Tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/audio/audio_streams.html)

An example implementation of a audio mixer menu is given in audio_mixer_menu.tscn. To add additional audio busses, it's only needed to do so in the "Audio" tab in Godot and to add additional volume containers. Also the script variables of the new sliders should be adjusted. especially the bus name and the example audio path.
