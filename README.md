# Godot Game Accessibility Guidelines
This project can be used as a starting point for a new Godot project.
It includes basic systems to use accessibility features as described by the [Game accessibility guidelines](https://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/).

The features are mostly implemented in addons. Also please read the Readme files inside of the specific addons. They will explain specific things about the features and how to use them.

## Implemented Accessibility Features:
- the controls can be remapped
- the UI can be controlled via mouse or keyboard
- the sensitivity of controls can be adjusted
- the default font is easily readable
- the default font size is chosen to be easily readable
- seperate volume controls are provided for effects, speech, background and music
- information about the implemented accessibility features is provided to the user

## Notes
- for different UI elements (e.g. ingame UI), the "ui_theme" might have to be reaplied
  - otherwise the separation of elements might be too small
